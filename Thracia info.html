Thracia 776 follows Leif Faris Clause, prince of house Leonster in the Manster district of Northern Thracia. When Leif was three his parents Quan and Ethlyn were ambushed and 
 killed and his infant 
 Sister Altena taken. A year later, his home castle Leonster was burned to the ground. This all orchestrated by the king of Southern Thracia, Travant, for full control over Thracia.
  Leif managed to escape thanks to the aid of his Father's faithful knight, Finn. Together they fled from city to city in Manster for years until they reached the city of Tahara, vowing to take back Leonster one day.
After spending a few years in Tahara Leif was found by the Thracian empire and fell under siege. Once again they had to flee, Finn sustaining a grievous wound this time. They fled to a town outside the Manster district
called Fiana. There they were sheltered by Eyvel, the leader of a band of mercenaries called "The Fiana Freeblades". There, Finn and Leif worked for Eyvel's mercenary company while taking shelter in Fiana, until they
are once again discovered by the empire, but this time Leif decides to fight. This is where the game begins
